# Roshan Fallah's Final independent project

**Background**

This project uses data from my Master's thesis.

my research investigates the root cause of hereditary ataxia and the pathological events that take place with this disorder.
Hereditary Ataxia is a neurodegenerative disorder which leads to neuronal death in the cerebellum. 

These neurons called purkinje cells, modulate input signals from the spinal cord and motor cortex in order for us carry out coordinated motor movements with hands, eyes, limbs and speech.
When these cells are lost, so is the communication with the rest of the brain and body leading to the disorder.
In this type of investigation, cell counts and soma size analyses are integral measurements for quantifying the earliest pathological changes.
The 3 datasets used in this repository contain a small group of values which represent totals and averages of several hundred samples. 
These experiments were carried out on both wildtype control rats and mutant ataxic rats.
